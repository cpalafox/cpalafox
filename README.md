## Hi there 👋

I'm Cesar Garza (he/him).

Principal Software Engineer with over 13 years of professional experience using Ruby on Rails! Passionate about quality, well designed, well tested code. I have had the pleasure to mentor multiple people in the past few years and help them reach their goals and promotions. Briding the gap between engineering and other non-technical functions can be challenging and I — through collaboration, empathy and understanding — enjoy helping teams work better together.

These days I'm finding myself putting some of my thoughts in writing at https://dev.to/cgarza.
